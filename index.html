                    and you are a young economic teacher, teaching an elegant economic theory in the class room, it
                    doesn't make you feel good. Because all your brilliant theories don't seem to, come into use of the
                    people who dying. And it 's death you cannot explain because it's not cause of disease. ..it's just
                    of not having food to eat...
                    So in the situation like that you have nothing but frustration and agony. So one way, I try to kind
                    of enlightened my frustration and agony by coming to the conclusion that I may not be useful as an
                    economist, but I'm still a basic human being. I can juts go out and stand next to human being. And
                    see if there's anything I can do to another person. Even for a day if it is help, pay for more a
                    day, I feel more a little bit better. So that's why I started going outside the campus..

                    I thought if you can become an angel for 27 dollars, it would be fun to do more of it ”
